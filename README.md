## 🚀 CI/CD Pipeline

A Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline was implemented using **GitHub Actions**.

### 🔄 How it works

Whenever a developer wants to add a new feature or modify the code:

1. The developer pushes the changes to the GitHub repository.
2. The CI/CD pipeline is automatically triggered.
3. The application is rebuilt and redeployed.
4. The changes are reflected remotely without manual intervention.

### 🎥 CI/CD Demonstration

In this video:
- We first show the current state of the navbar.
- Then, we modify the code.
- Finally, we observe the automatic update after the push, demonstrating the CI/CD pipeline in action.
